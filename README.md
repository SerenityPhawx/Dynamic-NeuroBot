***UPDATES***
I (Tiff) hav acquired a new welder's mask and will separate the headband to replace the one we borrowed.
This will be the backbone of the new headset v.2.0

Next week, I hope to have the reassembled hackathon version of the hesdset with new parts and will work on getting some sample data to test  the ML code for hemisphere differentiation.

After that, I will start fixing/rebuilding my nonlinear analysis segments to test with the raw data.

I will check to see where we left off with the robot.
I can build a new bot too if it would make things easier to have greater control with the interface.

Still like the Bluetooth idea if we can manage the hack -- I'll try to get the specs on the BT components we have to work with.

Please feel free to email me, update the etherpad, or find me on facebook or jabber (phawx@c-base.org or serenityphawx@jabber.de).

* Alpha - 8-15 Hz   (eye closing; relaxation; "Berger")
* Beta  - 16-31 Hz  (alert; attenuated during motor behaviour; concentration)
* Gamma - 32+ Hz    (debated)
